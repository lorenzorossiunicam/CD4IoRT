** GENERAL INFORMATION and GOAL OF THE WORKSHOP **
The objective of the First Workshop on Conceptual Desing for Internet of Robotic Things (CD4IoRT) is to foster the use of conceptual design in the Internet of Robotic Things (IoRT) domain. Thanks to the advantages brought into everyday human life, IoRT systems have emerged as key technologies with a wide range of applications, in many application domains, e.g., agriculture, manufacturing, industry, domotics, and health. However, the implementation and management of these systems require a broad set of skills. This knowledge gap can be closed by novel conceptual modeling and engineering approaches specific to these software systems. The workshop aims to be a point of contact for practitioners and researchers from Conceptual Modeling with other communities such as Software Engineering, Databases, Business Process Management, Distributed Systems, Formal Methods, and Information Systems where creating a dialogue centered on the development of scientific foundations in this topic. The workshop will foster the discussion of research works case studies, experiences, and industry showcases in order to set up joint activities and future research directions.



** LIST OF TOPICS **
We seek contributions covering all aspects of data modeling for IoRT data applications including, but not limited to, the following topics:

Conceptual modeling and languages for IoRT data 
Model-driven engineering for IoRT systems
Low code methods for IoRT systems
Integration and querying IoRT data
Requirement engineering for IoRT systems
IoRT and Artificial Intelligence
Edge-Fog-Cloud architectures design
Data and QoS modeling
Real-time, NoSQL databases
Data stream management systems design
Embedded systems design
Real-life (Urban, agriculture, health, â€¦) applications
